    <h1>Solitude...</h1>
    <h2>A curated video of a still life set up</h2>
    <h3>Made with Da Vinci</h3>
  </div>

 
  <p>
    <em>"Solitude"</em> is a video edit made out of a variation of shots that capture the details and overall essence of a set up still life. It was created using the software Da Vinci for an assignment CW2. This was by far my favourite task for DGA1020 as I love capturing an atmosphere and conveying deeper meanings through the art of video making. This website is dedicated to analyzing and appreciating this work as well as inviting <strong>you</strong>, the viewer, to feel inspired and recreate your own version of <em>"Solitude".</em>

  <h2>Mood & Visual Style</h2>
  <p>
    This video presents a dreamy and cinematic experience, capturing an intimate, almost nostalgic moment. The aim was to represent a moment of solitude—whether by choice or not. This video was inspired by the moments of being alone when it feels like it is just you and the world. The tone is set through golden-hour lighting that bathes the visuals in soft, amber hues, creating a warm homely and comforting mood. Close-up and mid-range shots focus on personal moments, emphasizing one's inner thoughts and personal joys. There’s a softness to the visuals, achieved through shallow depth of field and diffused lighting, enhancing the reflective and tender atmosphere.

  <h2>Sound & Pacing</h2>
  <p>
    The pacing is slow and intentional, allowing each scene to breathe and the viewer to absorb the emotion without feeling rushed. The soundtrack is minimalist and melodic—it is what ultimately inspired the video. The soundtrack "Solitude" by Billie Holiday has been a track that has filled me with warmth and peace, and that is exactly what I wanted to convey within my work to the viewer. It blends seamlessly with the imagery, enhancing the tranquil tone. Smooth transitions and consistent rhythm help maintain a cohesive flow, making the video feel polished and thoughtfully constructed from start to finish.

  <h2>Emotional Impact & Cohesion</h2>
  <p>
    What truly makes the video effective is the harmony between all elements. The visuals, sound, color grading, chosen items, and pacing all aligned with a clear emotional intention. It feels like a tribute to a meaningful connection whether with a person, a place, or a fleeting moment. Despite one being alone, a connection is still felt. The video doesn’t rely on complexity but instead thrives on its restraint, offering a quiet, genuine emotional pause. The result is a mood piece that resonates well beyond its short runtime, leaving the viewer with a lasting sense of calm and connection.
